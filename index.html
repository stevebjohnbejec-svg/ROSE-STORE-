    <h3>HISTORY OF THE BUSINESS</h3>
    <p>
      ROSE Store was established in 2010 by Mrs. Rose Sesaldo in Boljoon, Cebu. 
      Starting as a small sari-sari store, it provided daily necessities to the community. 
      Through affordable prices and friendly service, it became trusted by residents.

      Rose Sesaldo, born in 1987, built her store through patience and determination.

      neighborhood shop known for kindness and honesty.

      In the future, ROSE STORE may expand into a bigger grocery-style shop
